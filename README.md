# TicTacToe

[Live version](https://artlp.github.io/TicTacToe/)

This is an assignment from The Odin Project Course: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe

**There were a few major challenges to overcome:**
- Reassigning players' colors and markers, it was not working with module pattern, so players are globally declared classes to make it work.
- Adding a CPU opponent
- Understanding how modules interact with each other

**Known issues:**

1. on iOS 14 Safari the game shows up as a blank page
2. vertical scroll everywhere (drawback of my 3 screen layout)
3. footer is displayed incorrectly on the settings screen
4. player markers are not properly aligned (blame unicode symbols)
5. scores are overlapping the gameboard on mobile (fine in PC browser mobile phones simulation)
